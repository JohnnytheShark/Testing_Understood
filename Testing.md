# Unit Testing 

Unit tests are written as independent modules testing the processes of a function without the use of external dependencies. It is isolated and runs fast. 

## Arrange-Act-Assert 

When writing your unit tests to write them in the following pattern: 
Arrange-Act-Assert 
Meaning: 
Arrange - Creating the mockup of things that are needed to run the function 
Act - We are calling the function with the mockups 
Assert - We are checking the actual against the expected. 

# Integration Testing 
Integration Testing is how the system interacts with external dependencies. Integration testing can sometimes increase the problem of having too many things it is testing at once.
